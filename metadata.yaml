description: In 1921, Ben Hecht wrote a column for the Chicago Daily News that his
  editor called "journalism extraordinary; journalism that invaded the realm of literature."
  Hecht's collection of sixty-four of these pieces, illustrated with striking pen
  drawings by Herman Rosse, is a timeless caricature of urban American life in the
  jazz age, updated with a new Introduction for the twenty-first century. From the
  glittering opulence of Michigan Avenue to the darkest ruminations of an escaped
  convict, from captains of industry to immigrant day laborers, Hecht captures 1920s
  Chicago in all its furor, intensity, and absurdity.
